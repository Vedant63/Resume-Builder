The Resume Generator is a web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to input their resume details through a form and preview the formatted resume dynamically. Key features include rich text editing for work experience and academic sections, powered by CKEditor, enabling users to format content directly in the browser. The application also includes a toggle function to switch between editing and preview modes, and a print feature to easily produce a physical copy of the resume. The design is responsive, ensuring usability across differentÂ devices.
